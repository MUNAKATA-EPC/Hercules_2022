Usini Sensors Kicad Schematics
----------------------
![3D models](sources/images/3D.png)
This is my libraries of sensors breakout board for Kicad.
* All models are checked (but it is not guaranted to have no errors).
* All schematics/footprints are CC-0 public domain (some exception for 3D models)

Theses files included:
* **usini_sensors.pretty** folder with step (3D models) / kicad_mod (footprints files)
* **usini_sensors.dcm** (Schematics information)
* **usini_sensors.lib** (Schematics)

Just copy theses files in your kicad project, and add the links in the *preferences*

# How it was made
I recorded myself doing most of these.
* [Youtube Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2__ODQvKKTA)
* [Youtube Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mm6G-MrL5dA)
* [Youtube Part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xK2-JJZ6IQ)

It tooks me around 8 hours to made it which would have cost 81,2€ on minimal wage, so feel free to donate at https://ko-fi.com/usini
